		</div>
		<div class='story__text'>
			<p>Shirley Jackson was a literary superstar of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. She wrote 17 books, won significant awards, and had her work adapted for television, film, and the ballet.</p>

			<p>Jackson was also a woman, wife, and mother, and her career was plagued by sexism. In her memoir, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/330235/life-among-the-savages-by-shirley-jackson/"><em>Life Among the Savages</em></a>, Jackson wrote about going to the hospital to deliver her third child, and having the following exchange with the receptionist:</p>

			<blockquote class='exchange tk-canela'>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Occupation?”</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“I'll just put down housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
		    </blockquote>

			<p>It certainly seems like gender equality in literary authorship has come a long way in the past seventy years. For one thing: if a woman says she's a writer, I think people have an easier time accepting that she's a goddamned writer.</p>

			<p>Then again, I'm a writer and a woman. And I'm an optimist, so I could be wrong.</p>

			<p>How much progress has American literature actually made towards gender equality in the past 70 years?</p>
			
			<p>To answer this question, I looked at the gender of the authors of books on the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list over time.</p>

			<p>The list has published weekly since the 1940s. It features the 10-15 best-selling fiction books in America that week. Making it onto the list is a good indicator of a book’s commercial success &mdash; the list is based off of surveys of booksellers &mdash; but it’s also a marketing boon on its own, as people often discover or purchase books that appear on the list. Tracking the gender ratio on the list seems like a good way to measure the changing relationship between author gender and commercial success.</p>

			<p>Books by women composed 22-31% of the list in the 1950s. The 1960s and the 1970s were inconsistent. Female representation on the list in this period got as high as 38% in 1970, and as low as 14% in 1975. Some of this was simple math: the <em>New York Times</em> temporarily capped the list to 10 books per week starting in 1963. This made the annual list of best sellers shorter, and the gender ratio more sensitive to changes in the counts from year to year.</p>

			<p>But the volatility of the ratio in the 1960s and 1970s might also owe to politics and social change. It probably isn’t a coincidence that the <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_movement">women’s liberation movement</a> was in full swing at the time. Before digging into the data, I guessed that the gender ratio would start out male biased, and if it evened out, the change would occur in the 1960s and 1970s, as a direct result of feminism. Better education for women, better birth control technology, more women in the workplace, and a whole cultural movement around championing the female voices and perspectives seemed like it would obviously result in more women authors on the best seller list.</p>

			<p>Whatever actually happened in the 1960s and 1970s was more complicated than I had expected. Long after the bras were burned and the 10-book limit was lifted, not much had changed: in both 1990 and 1950, 28% of the books on the list were written by women. Lasting change didn’t come until the 1990s, when female writers made steady gains on the list over ten years. 2001 saw the highest ratio of all time: 50% women, 50% men. After that, the rate dipped and flattened, just beneath the 50% line.</p>

			<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>What happened in the 1990s?</h3>
			<p>The <em>Times</em> has a long-standing policy against commenting on its best seller methodology beyond the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/?_r=0">public information posted online</a>. This is partially because they don’t want authors trying to game the system. But, as Danielle Ha Rhoades, VP of Communications, wrote me in an email, “There has been no change in our methodology that would affect the female-to-male author ratio.”</p>

			<p>This means that the change in the ratio likely reflects the literature market moving toward gender equality.</p>

			<p>Since most of this change occurred in the 1990s, I was curious to see which authors performed the best during this decade, as compared to other decades. Here, binned by decade, are the top-performing authors on the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list, as measured by how many books of theirs made the list in that time period.</p>

			<ul class='notice'>

				<li>The list is getting harder to top. For example: romance novelist Danielle Steel was the top author of the 1990s, with 15 best-selling titles in 10 years. An author needed 15 best-selling titles to even make it into the top 10 in the 2000s, but Steel came in first again, with 25 best-selling books.</li>

				<li>There was only one woman on the top-performers list in the 1980s...Steel again, who tied for third with science-fiction author/Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.</li>

				<li>The top performers from the 1970s onward were universally authors of <em>genre fiction</em>.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>To learn more, I roughly categorized every book on the list by genre using a <a target='_blank' href="http://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science/fast.html">subject heading database</a> provided by the Library of Congress. The result of this research is in the chart below.</p>

			<p>Critics and scholars call books that are written to fit into a specific genre &mdash; such as mystery, romance, sci-fi, and horror &mdash; “genre fiction.”  Genre fiction is often compared to “literary fiction.” In practice literary fiction generally refers to books written by people with MFA degrees and/or teaching positions; books which tend to to be critically acclaimed; and those which usually do not involve things like aliens, magic, private investigators, or cowboys.</p>

			<p>In the chart above, books that fall into one of the smaller genres &mdash; such as historical fiction and domestic fiction &mdash; were labeled "Other." Books that didn’t seem to fall into a genre at all were labeled “Literary/None".</o>

			<p>As you can see, genre fiction at large enjoyed a heyday through the 1980s, and the 1990s &mdash; our period of interest. Though it remained prominent in the 1990s, it gradually waned in popularity over the decade, and dropped off significantly in the early 2000s.</p>

			<p>You might know people who exclusively read romance novels, mystery novels, or sci-fi novels. And you might know people who refuse to read them. There are plenty of authors who specialize in writing in a particular genre. Each of these categories has a market of its own. So to understand the relationship between the genre of best-selling books and author gender, I took a look at each of these genres by decade, and tracked the gender ratio for each decade with at least 10 books within the genre on the best seller list.</p>

			<p>Almost every category started out as male-dominated, and many have stayed that way. Fantasy and science fiction, spy and political fiction, suspense fiction, and adventure fiction, have all been consistently male-dominated since their introduction to the list.</p>

			<p>Most best-selling books fall into the Literary/None category, and this closely matches the overall gender ratio &mdash; shifting from extreme bias to close to parity between the 1980s and the 2000s.</p>

			<p>Then, there are the genres that have flipped. The horror/paranormal genre is now almost at gender parity, owing no small thanks to paranormal romance novels. Mystery is the most balanced genre over time, which shouldn't be surprising given the genre's history. The 1920s and 30s are known as the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction," and were dominated by a quartet of female authors known as the Queens of Crime &mdash; Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham.</p>

			<p>Best-selling romance novels were mostly written by men in the 1950s. But the romance novel industry, with specialized publishers, only really developed in the 1960s and the 1970s. By the 1960s, most romance novels were written by women. As a genre that is mostly about women, and mostly read by women, it was probably most vulnerable to changing politics regarding sex and gender. In 1972 the content of romance fiction became a lot more explicit, following the development of the “bodice-ripper” novel. The term comes from the fact that these first, more explicitly-described scenes tended not to be consensual — because norms fetishizing female chastity persisted even in romance novels. Thankfully, attitudes towards sex and gender changed, and literature changed with them. By the 1980s, women authors solidly dominated the genre, probably because female writers had a natural advantage writing for mostly female readers about mostly female experiences of love and sex.</p>

		<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>Why aren't we at parity?</h3>

		<p>We’ve found that women have an easier time making it onto the Best Seller’s List today than they did in the 1950s, and that a lot of the change happened in the period between 1990 and 2001. We’ve also found that the gender ratio varies a lot between the different genres of fiction, even today &mdash; e.g. a best-selling female fantasy/scifi author today is just as rare as a best-selling female literary author in the 1950s. Some of the change in gender ratio over the 1990s can be explained by male-dominated genres fading out, while non-genre fiction became more prominent and more female.</p>

		<p>But one big question remains about the change in gender ratio: Why did it stop when it did? Why aren’t 50% of the books on the list written by women? Or, for that matter, 60%?</p>

		<p>One theory is that, though the market now embraces female authors, the industry itself has not caught up. Non-genre fiction is the most prominent category on the list, and there’s evidence that women are at a significant disadvantage in this particular area &mdash; both in marketing and production.</p>

		<p>More than in the genres, sales in non-genre fiction depend on critical attention and critical acclaim. <a target='_blank' href="http://www.vidaweb.org/">VIDA Count</a> is a non-profit that goes through literary journalism outlets and tallies the genders of the writers whose works are featured and reviewed in those outlets. According to their most recent study, in 2015, books by women made up less than 20% of books reviewed in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, 30% in <em>Harper’s</em>, 29% in the <em>Atlantic</em>, and 22% in the <em>London Review of Books</em>.</p>

		<p>A lot of this seems to owe to gender bias in publishing. In 2011, inspired by an earlier VIDA Count report, Ruth Franklin at the <em>New Republic</em> did a <a target='_blank' href="https://newrepublic.com/article/82930/vida-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews">small-scale analysis</a> of the authors in the catalogs of 13 publishing houses. The most balanced publishing house was a small one, and published 45% women, 55% men. The rest were heavily male biased. “Random House came in second,” <a target='_blank' href="https://newrepublic.com/article/82930/vida-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews">Franklin wrote</a>, “with 37 percent by women. It was downhill from there, with three publishers scoring around 30 percent—Norton, Little Brown, and Harper—and the rest 25 percent and below, including the elite literary houses Knopf (23 percent) and FSG (21 percent).” The <em>Huffington Post</em> followed her study up in 2012 with <a target='_blank' href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/13/book-gender_n_1324560.html">similar findings</a> of gender bias in publishing.
</p>

		<p>Reporters who have written about this have grasped for an explanation beyond just plain sexism. Institutional sexism like this doesn’t boil down to one or two men-in-charge being pig-headed misogynists. As Laura Miller wrote in <em><a target='_blank' href="http://www.salon.com/2011/02/09/women_literary_publishing/">Salon</a></em>:</p>

		<blockquote><p><em>Book publishers, like any other business, want to make money, and multiple surveys indicate that women buy and read far more books than men do...If women were only &mdash; or even primarily &mdash; interested in books by women, the logic of the marketplace would dictate that publishers should release more titles by female authors.</em></p></blockquote>

		<p>Unfortunately our dataset doesn't give us any clues as to why publishing and criticism are so gender biased. If the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list is any indication, Miller is right about the fiction market. It’s remarkable that in such a biased climate, nearly 50% of best sellers are by women. And it probably means there's more demand for female-authored literature than is being supplied or promoted.</p>

			<p class='x-small'><strong>Sources and Methodology:</strong> <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller List data was taken from the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.hawes.com/pastlist.htm">Hawes Publications</a> website. Analysis is limited to hardcover fiction.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>Gender was tagged by linking a book’s entry in the Library of Congress <a target='_blank' href="http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/">OCLC classify system</a> to the author’s page in the <a target='_blank' href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File</a> database, which includes gender information. Books credited to mixed-gender writing teams, corporate entities, and fictional characters were excluded from the analysis.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>Genre was tagged by using <a target='_blank' href="http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/">OCLC classify system</a> to fetch <a target='_blank' href="http://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science/fast.html">FAST Subject Headings</a> for every edition of the book, which are assigned by <a target='_blank' href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">Library of Congress partner libraries</a> around the country. Some FAST Subject Headings indicate work of a particular genre. When more than 1% of tagged holdings of a book were tagged with a genre-specific subject heading, the book was assigned to that genre. When a book was tagged with subject headings for multiple genres, the book was assigned to the genre that corresponded to the subject heading with the most holdings. Books without sufficient FAST Subject Headings to assign a genre were classified “Literary/None”.</p>
