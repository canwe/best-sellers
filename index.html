			<p>Shirley Jackson was a literary superstar of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. She several pieces collected in <em>Best American Short Stories</em>, won the O'Henry award, and was finalist for the National Book award. Her stories were turned into movies, television, and a ballet. She’s best known for “The Lottery,” which is one of the most famous stories in American Literature.</p>

			<p>Jackson was also a woman, wife, and mother, and her career was plagued by sexism. In her memoir, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/330235/life-among-the-savages-by-shirley-jackson/"><em>Life Among the Savages</em></a>, Jackson wrote about going to the hospital to deliver her third child, and having the following exchange with the receptionist:</p>

			<blockquote class='exchange tk-canela'>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Occupation?”</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“I'll just put down housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
		    </blockquote>

			<p>I want to think things have changed. I <em>want</em> to think if a woman says she's a writer, today, people accept that she's a goddamned writer. But do female writers actually have an easier time these days than Shirley Jackson did?</p>

			<p>How much progress has American literature actually made towards gender equality in the past 70 years?</p>
			
			<p>To answer this question, I looked at the gender of the authors of books on the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list over time.</p>

			<p>Tracking the gender ratio on the list seems like a good way to measure the changing relationship between author gender and commercial success. The list has been published weekly since the 1940s. It features the 10-15 best-selling fiction books in America that week. Making it onto the list is a good indicator of a book’s commercial success &mdash; the list is based off of surveys of booksellers &mdash; but it’s also a marketing boon on its own, as people often discover or purchase books that appear on the list.</p>

			<p>Books by women consistently made up about a quarter of the list in the 1950s. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, female representation on the list fluctuated dramatically. The rate of books by women got as high as 38% in 1970, and as low as 14% in 1975.</p>

			<p>Some of this was simple math: the <em>New York Times</em> temporarily capped the list to 10 books per week starting in 1963. This made the annual list of best sellers shorter, and the gender ratio more sensitive to changes in the counts from year to year.</p>

			<p>Social change might also have played a role. Before I saw the numbers, I guessed they would start out male-biased in the 1950s, then balance out in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_movement">feminist movement</a>. Better education for women, better birth control technology, better wages, and a whole cultural movement championing female voices and perspectives seemed like it would obviously result in more women authors on the best seller list.</p>

			<p>Whatever actually happened in the 1960s and 1970s was more complicated than I had expected. Long after the bras were burned and the 10-book limit was lifted, not much had changed: in both 1990 and 1950, 28% of the books on the list were written by women. Lasting change didn’t come until the 1990s, when female writers made steady gains on the list over ten years. 2001 saw the highest ratio of all time: 50% women, 50% men. After that, the rate dipped and flattened, just beneath the 50% line.</p>

			<p>This is <em>a piece</em> of our answer, and it's good news. Among commercially successful authors in Shirley Jackson’s time, men outnumbered women 3 to 1. Now, that number is close to 1 to 1.</p>
 
			<p>But it would be a mistake to to conclude, from a nearly 50/50 gender ratio, that bias no longer exists. The actual story of gender representation in American literature is nuanced. As we'll see, in certain aspects of literature, gender bias is still alive and well.</p>

			<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>What happened in the 1990s?</h3>

			<p>Since most of the change in the gender ratio occurred in the 1990s, I was curious to see which authors performed the best during this decade, as compared to other decades. Here, binned by decade, are the top-performing authors on the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list, as measured by how many books of theirs made the list in that time period.</p>

			<p class='no-margin'>Things to notice:</p>
			<ul class='notice'>

				<li>The list is getting harder to top. For example: The top author of the 1990s had 15 best-selling titles in 10 years. In the 2000s, an author needed 15 best-selling titles to even make it into the top 10, and the top author had 25. (Impressively, the #1 slot went to the same person in both decades: romance novelist Danielle Steel.)</li>

				<li>There was only one woman on the top-performers list in the 1980s...Steel again, who tied for third with science-fiction author/Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.</li>

				<li>The top performers from the 1970s onward were universally authors of <em>genre fiction</em>.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>To learn more, I roughly categorized every book on the list by genre using a <a target='_blank' href="http://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science/fast.html">subject heading database</a> provided by the Library of Congress. The result of this research is in the chart below. Books that fell into one of the smaller genres &mdash; such as historical fiction and domestic fiction &mdash; were labeled "Other." Books that didn’t seem to fall into a genre at all were labeled “Literary/None".</p>

			<p>Critics call books that are written to fit into a specific genre &mdash; such as mystery, romance, sci-fi, and horror &mdash; “genre fiction.” Genre fiction is often compared to “literary fiction.” In practice literary fiction generally refers to books written by people with MFA degrees and/or teaching positions; books which tend to to be critically acclaimed; and those which usually do not involve things like aliens, magic, private investigators, or cowboys.</p>

			<p>As you can see, relative to other fiction, genre fiction sold the best in the 1980s. Though it remained prominent in the 1990s, it gradually waned in popularity over the decade, and dropped off significantly in the early 2000s.</p>

			<p>Here is where some of the nuance comes in: Each of these categories kind of has a market of its own. You might know people who exclusively read romance novels, mystery novels, or sci-fi novel, or who refuse to read them. There are plenty of authors who specialize in writing in a particular genre.</p>

			<p>So I took a look at the gender ratio <em>within</em> each categoru. I binned each of these genres by decade, and tracked the gender ratio for each decade with at least 10 books within the genre on the best seller list.</p>

			<p>Almost every category started out as male-dominated, and many have stayed that way. These categories align with stereotypes about male interests. Fantasy and science fiction, spy and political fiction, suspense fiction, and adventure fiction, have all been consistently male-dominated since their introduction to the list.</p>

			<p>Then, there are the genres that have flipped. The horror/paranormal genre is now almost at gender parity, owing no small thanks to paranormal romance novels. Mystery is the most balanced genre over time, which shouldn't be surprising given the genre's history. The 1920s and 30s are known as the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction," and were dominated by a quartet of female authors known as the Queens of Crime &mdash; Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham.</p>

			<p>Best-selling romance novels were mostly written by men in the 1950s, but in the 1960s women took over. In 1972, mainstream romance novels started depicting sexual intercourse, following the development of the “bodice-ripper” novel. The term comes from the fact that because of norms fetishizing female chastity, these that these first sex scenes tended not to be consensual. Thankfully, norms changed, and literature changed with them. By the 1980s, female authors solidly dominated the genre, probably because female writers had a natural advantage writing for mostly female readers about mostly female experiences of love and sex.</p>

		<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>The feminization of literary fiction</h3>
			<p>If we are looking for a single category to explain why women are better represented among best-selling authors today, the Literary/None category is our best candidate. Most best-selling books fall into this category, and its change over time closely matches the overall gender ratio — shifting from extreme bias in the 1980s to close to parity in the 2000s. This category’s share of the list also increased over the 1990s, as genre fiction waned.</p>
 
			<p>While we can’t say for sure why either of these things happened, we can theorize. It turns out that in the 1990s, colleges started training people to produce non-genre fiction at record rates -- which might account for the relative rise of non-genre fiction on the best sellers list. And it also turns out that most of these new creative writing students were women.</p>

			<p>Poets <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-program-era-and-the-mainly-white-room/">Juliana Spahr and Stephanie Young</a> collected the above data from <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/home/usethedata">IPEDS</a>, a federal database of post-secondary education statistics. The above charts include poetry students as well as fiction students. Prior to 1988, and in the 1989-1994 data, IPEDS didn’t distinguish creative writing MFAs from other graduate studies in English.</p>

			<p>Between 1988 and 2000, the number of people earning MFAs in creative writing tripled. Spahr and Young also found that these new degree-earners were 59-66% female.</p>
 
			<p>The vast majority of MFA programs in fiction focus on teaching students to produce non-genre/literary work. Many of MFA students graduate with workshop-polished first books, and the contacts to at least have a shot at publication. Colleges are now graduating thousands of MFAs per year, pumping many more, disproportionately female authors into the market.</p>

		<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>The industry is more biased than the market</h3>

		<p>So far, this might look pretty OK to you. Especially if, unlike me, you don't care much about genre fiction.</p>

		<p>We’ve found that women have an easier time making it onto the Best Seller’s List today than they did in the 1950s, and that a lot of the change happened in the period between 1990 and 2001. We’ve also found that the gender ratio varies a lot between the different genres of fiction &mdash; a best-selling female fantasy/sci-fi author today is just as rare as a best-selling female literary author in the 1950s. Some of the change in gender ratio over the 1990s can be explained by male-dominated genres fading out, while non-genre fiction became more prominent and more female.</p>

		<p>But we’re not done here! The data seems to say that, today, overall, books by women are as valuable to the book-buying public as books by men. And that leaves us with a nagging question: <em>Why doesn’t the publishing industry seem to recognize this?</em></p>

		<p>There’s a ton of existing research on this. Every year, the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.vidaweb.org/">VIDA Count</a> organization goes through literary journalism outlets and tallies the genders of the writers whose works are featured and reviewed in those outlets. According to their most recent study, in 2015 books by women made up less than 20% of books reviewed in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, 30% in <em>Harper’s</em>, 29% in the <em>Atlantic</em>, and 22% in the <em>London Review of Books</em>.</p>

		<p>A lot of the bias in reviews reflects a bias in publishing. In 2011, inspired by VIDA, Ruth Franklin at the <em>New Republic</em> did a <a target='_blank' href="https://newrepublic.com/article/82930/vida-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews">small-scale analysis</a> of the upcoming catalogs of 13 publishing houses. Franklin found that 11 of the 13 publishers, including Harper, Norton, Little Brown, Knopf and FSG, had heavily male biased catalogs &mdash; around 30% or less of their books were written by women. The <em>Huffington Post</em> followed her study up in 2012 with <a target='_blank' href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/13/book-gender_n_1324560.html">similar findings</a> of widespread gender bias.
		</p>

		<p>If you’re persuaded that most of the trend towards gender balance in the 1990s was due to the expansion of the MFA, the biases in publication and criticism might explain why the growth of female authorship on the Best Sellers list did not continue into the 2000s. MFA programs have continued to expand, and about 2/3s of MFA earners are women, but the gender ratio on the Best Sellers list has been frozen at under 50% since the early 2000s. The statistics suggest publishers and critics aren’t giving these new young authoresses the chance they deserve.</p>

		<p>Institutional sexism like this is bad for business. As Laura Miller wrote in <em><a target='_blank' href="http://www.salon.com/2011/02/09/women_literary_publishing/">Salon</a></em>:</p>

		<blockquote><p><em>Book publishers, like any other business, want to make money, and multiple surveys indicate that women buy and read far more books than men do...If women were only &mdash; or even primarily &mdash; interested in books by women, the logic of the marketplace would dictate that publishers should release more titles by female authors.</em></p></blockquote>

		<p>If the <em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list is any indication, Miller is right about the fiction market. In fact, it’s remarkable that in such a biased climate, nearly 50% of best sellers are by women. It probably means there's more demand for female-authored literature than is being supplied or promoted. Publishers, take note.</p>

		<div class='methodology tk-atlas'>
		<p class='x-small'><strong>Sources and Methodology Notes:</strong><em> New York Times</em> Best Seller List data was taken from the <a target='_blank' href="http://www.hawes.com/pastlist.htm">Hawes Publications</a> website. Analysis is limited to hardcover fiction.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>Gender was tagged by linking a book’s entry in the Library of Congress <a target='_blank' href="http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/">OCLC classify system</a> to the author’s page in the <a target='_blank' href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File</a> database, which includes gender information. Books credited to mixed-gender writing teams, corporate entities, and fictional characters were excluded from the analysis.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>Genre was tagged by using <a target='_blank' href="http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/">OCLC classify system</a> to fetch <a target='_blank' href="http://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science/fast.html">FAST Subject Headings</a> for every edition of the book, which are assigned by <a target='_blank' href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">Library of Congress partner libraries</a> around the country. Some FAST Subject Headings indicate work of a particular genre. When more than 1% of tagged holdings of a book were tagged with a genre-specific subject heading, the book was assigned to that genre. When a book was tagged with subject headings for multiple genres, the book was assigned to the genre that corresponded to the subject heading with the most holdings. Books without sufficient FAST Subject Headings to assign a genre were classified “Literary/None”.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>Genres in the “Other” category: historical fiction, domestic fiction, religious fiction, legal fiction, war fiction.</p>

			<p class='x-small'>The <em>New York Times</em> has a long-standing policy against commenting on its best seller methodology beyond the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/?_r=0">public information posted online</a>. However, Danielle Ha Rhoades, VP of Communications, clarified in an email: “There has been no change in our methodology that would affect the female-to-male author ratio.”</p>
